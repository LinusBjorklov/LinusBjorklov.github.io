    <p>There's much written on www about history of the <br>
        Internet. For example, about the first graphical Internet <br>
        browser on the web - Mosaic.<br>
        <br> 
        <blockquote>Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical <br>
            World Wide Web browser, released on April 22, <br>
            1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina. <br>
            A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later.</blockquote> <br>
        <br>
        Today's Internet browsers we use today (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.), got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.
